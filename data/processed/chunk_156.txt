9.2 Disciplinary measures
Disciplinary measures may be imposed whenever there is a finding of misconduct. Upon a
finding of misconduct, disciplinary measures imposed by GESCI on a staff member will
be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any decision on disciplinary measures will take
into account such factors as the seriousness of the matter, any extenuating circumstances,
the situation of the staff member, the interests of GESCI, and the frequency of conduct for
which disciplinary measures may be imposed. Depending on the circumstances of the case, one or more of the following disciplinary
measures may be taken by GESCI when misconduct is determined to have occurred:
 Verbal or written warning;
 Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for salary increment or considerations
for promotion;
• Suspension from duty without pay for a specified period;
 Reassignment to a lower remunerated role in GESCI
 Removal of privileges or benefits, whether permanently or for a specified period of
time;
