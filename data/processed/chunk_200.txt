The office telephone in Nairobi is primarily for local calls. It may only be used for
international calls if the rates are cheaper. Calls from mobile phones are expensive and
should only be used as a last resort. Mobile phones should as a rule be both Wi-Fi and
Skype enabled. 11.3.2 GESCI Skype Account
Staff should have a GESCI Skype account for business purposes. Staff members are
expected to use a separate Skype account for personal use. The GESCI Skype account for each person will be set up on GESCIâ€™s Business Control
Panel. This will allow credit top-ups to be paid and managed centrally by the GESCI
Finance team. Staff should note that this will also provide GESCI with a record of all call traffic and
that the GESCI Skype account is actively monitored. 11.3.3Provision of a Mobile Phone
GESCI may provide a company mobile phone with Wi-Fi and Skype functionalities to
certain employees. It is at the discretion of GESCI management to determine whether or
not an employee fulfilling a particular role should be provided with a company mobile
Phone.
