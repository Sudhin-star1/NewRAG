Additionally, if the complaint concerns the HR Manager or for any
reason the staff member does not feel comfortable or does not wish to discuss the matter
with
the HR Manager, the staff member should submit a written complaint to any one of
GESCIâ€™s senior managers, or in the case where the complaint is against the Senior Manager,
to the CEO. The written complaint should be specific, identifying the policy or practice
alleged to have been violated and the individual who is alleged to have violated that policy
or practice. GESCI management will investigate the complaint, and render a decision in an
expeditious manner and in any event within 30 days of receiving the complaint. Where the complaint is against the CEO, the staff member should submit a written
complaint to the Chairman of the Board who shall render a decision expeditiously and
in any event within 30 days of receiving the complaint. In all cases where a complaint is registered, the person complained about will be notified
and given a chance to explain their side of the story.
