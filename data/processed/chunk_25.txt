In
addition, all personnel in a supervisory role at GESCI who either observe conduct that
appears to violate this policy or receive a complaint of conduct that would violate
this policy, must immediately report the incident to the Manager: Finance and Operations
and/or to the CEO, so that an investigation can be commenced where
appropriate. Where the complaint is against the CEO, the complaint may be made to the
Board. GESCI’s policy similarly prohibits sexually harassing conduct by any GESCI personnel
that may create an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment whether it be in the
form of physical, verbal or visual harassment and regardless of whether committed by an
individual with supervisory authority or by any other individual. Such conduct includes
but is not limited to unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances or propositions; verbal abuse
of a sexual nature; graphic verbal comments about an individual’s body; sexually
degrading words used to describe an individual; and the display in the workplace of
sexually suggestive objects or pictures.
