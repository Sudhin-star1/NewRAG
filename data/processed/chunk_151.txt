9 GRIEVANCE, DISCIPLINARY AND
DISMISSAL POLICY
By accepting employment with GESCI, staff agrees to work in a responsible, disciplined,
harmonious and productive manner. Staff will be expected to be loyal to the organization and act
in a manner conducive to the achievement of its objectives. It is the expectation of GESCI that all its staff members’ conduct is beyond reproach and
that the staff members’ loyalty, commitment and dedication to work are demonstrated by
productive results in their work outputs. The purpose of establishing disciplinary procedures for organization is not to police staff behavior
but to give mechanisms to ensure minimum standards of behavior are observed in accordance
with GESCI values. It is the intention of GESCI that disciplinary action shall have the aim of
correcting or improving performance and conduct where breaches of discipline do not warrant
dismissal. All disciplinary hearings and actions are to be heard and recorded in the employee's
personal file by the Manager: Finance & Operations. Such disciplinary actions shall be duly
signed by the employee as well.
