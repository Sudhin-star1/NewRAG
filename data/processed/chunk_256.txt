In cases of illness, which is expected to continuebeyond sick leave accrual, the Short-Term DisabilityBenefit(if
applicable)and/or Family or Personal Leave provisionsof applicable provincial legislation will apply.Regular
full-time employees earn sick leave from the firstfull payroll period worked. Paid sick leave may notbe taken in
advance of accrual. However, employees are allowed10 ‘personal emergency leave’ days under the Employment
Standards Act. These may be taken at any time oncean employee begins work (i.e. regardless of probationary
period). However, they do not need to be paid. Sick Leave must be recorded as such on payroll timesheets so that accurate records can be maintained.All
information about an employee’s medical conditionis confidential and must be kept by the ED/CEO ina file
separate from the employee’s personnel file. Whenan employee is absent for medical reasons, the employee’s
regular personnel file will contain only the datesof the medical absence, not the medical reason(s)for the absence.
