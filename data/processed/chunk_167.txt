A staff member placed on administrative leave pending investigation shall be given a
written statement of the reason(s) for such leave and its probable duration, which, so far as
practicable, should not exceed three months. Administrative leave shall be with full pay except when the CEO decides that exceptional
circumstances exist which warrant the placement of a staff member on administrative leave
with partial pay or without pay. Placement on administrative leave shall be without prejudice to the rights of the staff
member and shall not constitute a disciplinary measure. If administrative leave is without
pay and either the allegations of misconduct are subsequently not sustained or it is
subsequently found that the conduct at issue does not warrant dismissal or separation, any
pay withheld shall be restored without delay. A staff member who has been placed on administrative leave may challenge the decision to
place him or her on such leave.
