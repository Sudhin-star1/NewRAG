Schedule, Hours & Vacation
Our Schedule
Employees are expected to work 40 hours per week, but we are flexible on where
and when that work gets done. Employees are expected to attend all meetings to which they have been invited
as a “required” participant. Communication is vital to the success of our team;
therefore, team members are expected to be reasonably accessible by phone,
Slack, and email between the hours of 11 AM–4 PM in their local timezone. Employees are able to work from home and/or remotely and the organization
will make all efforts to ensure a comparable work experience regardless of where
an employee is located. Any time that you won’t be available during the regular work day (9 AM to 5
PM locally) should be put on your work calendar so your colleagues will know
that you are not available. Vacation & Leave Policy
We are closed on all Federal holidays, the day after Thanksgiving, and during
the week between Christmas and the New Year.
