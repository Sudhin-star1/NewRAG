c) Outside employment and activities
On occasional bases, GESCI staff members are asked to carry out tasks for which they
receive payment or other benefits-in-kind on behalf of bodies other than GESCI as a
consequence of their official positions. While, in many instances, this practice does not give
rise to problems, there are certain circumstances where difficulties may arise, such as where
the task performed forms part of the official duties of a GESCI staff member or is performed
during normal working hours. The following guidelines provide a framework within which decisions in this area can be made.  Where because of his or her official position, a GESCI staff member is invited to carry out
work on behalf of an outside body, he or she shall notify the CEO in advance and may not
seek or retain payment (other than appropriate travel and subsistence expenses) or other
benefit where the proposed activity is part of the GESCI staff member’s duties.
