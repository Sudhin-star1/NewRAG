Websites such as the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Travel and Health website (http://www.who.int/ith/en/)
provide extensive advice on health issues for specific countries as well as general
travel advice. Advice should be sought in good time so that any recommended
immunizations can be given and/or drugs prescribed. Staff members are entitled to reclaim relevant health related business expenses such as
immunizations and prescriptions through their staff member expense claim.
