a) Appointment: A staff member appointed to a post subject to international recruitment at
the headquarters or another authorized duty station may be eligible for relocation benefits on
recruitment and on termination of employment. However, if the staff member has lived in the duty station area for a period of two years or
more prior to appointment, the staff member shall not be eligible to receive relocation
benefits. b) Authorized change of duty station: Any staff member who is officially transferred from

towards covering the cost of temporary accommodation for a maximum of two weeks at the
duty station on appointment or on official change of duty station.
