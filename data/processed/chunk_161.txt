This shall be seen as a counselling
session and the immediate Manager will keep a record of the incident. 9.3.3 Verbal and Written Warning - Minor Offences
A minor offence will normally be dealt with by the giving of “a verbal warning” followed
by a written warning if the verbal warning is not heeded. A record of such warnings must
be kept in the confidential file of the staff member. Minor offences include lateness (not
habitual), slackness and ordinary indiscretion. Verbal warning is the first stage of the formal disciplinary action. Normally the Manager is
to conduct a formal disciplinary interview and if necessary issue a verbal/oral warning. The
staff member should be forewarned of the purpose of the discussion, so that he/she can
bring a colleague (another staff member) to the meeting, if he/she so wishes. If the behaviour does not change after the first warning, then it will be necessary to hold a
further disciplinary interview and if necessary issue an official written warning.
