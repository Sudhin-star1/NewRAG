In the event that a staff member is found to be unfit for the job, GESCI reserves the right
in its sole discretion and subject to applicable employment laws to terminate the
employment on grounds of physical incapacity or to agree with the staff member to
change materially the employment relationship, for example, by reducing employment
from fulltime to part-time. In consideration of such change, the staff member will be required to sign and fully comply
with an agreement setting forth the terms of the changed employment relationship and a
general release satisfactory to GESCI.
