7.3 Promotion /Advancement
Promotion involves the advancement of a staff member from one job category to another
with more responsibility and authority. Promotion has an added cost/value. In the case of
GESCI, promotion and advancement are synonymous although advancement could have
wider connotations. For GESCI, promotion will occur when, subject to GESCI’s overall recruitment policy, a
staff member is elevated to a more senior level post which has fallen vacant or is newly
created. Such an elevation or appointment will be based on the recognition of the staff
member’s good and exemplary performance in her/his current post and her/his ability to
perform higher duties and responsibilities. This will be determined through assessment and
appraisal reports. An internal competitive process may also be required. The effective date for promotions described above is the first day of the month following
the promotion decision. Salary increases due to promotion will also start on the effective
date. .
