Receiving benefits might
also be seen to compromise their personal judgement or integrity and that of GESCI as an
organization. Where possible therefore, staff members should actively discourage external parties from
offering gifts, benefits or favours. Gifts, benefits or favours should be declined wherever
possible. The overriding concern is that the actions of GESCI staff members be above
suspicion and not give rise to any actual or potential conflict of interest, and that
their dealings with all external parties or organizations should bear the closest possible
scrutiny. GESCI staff is not be allowed to undertake paid consultancies or any other form of paid
employment during the course of their employment. This includes evenings, weekends or
while on leave.
