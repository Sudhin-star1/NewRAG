In cases where payment is made in appreciation of work done by a member of staff, this
payment must be declared and revert to GESCI. a) Gifts
The receipt of gifts, as distinct from hospitality, by GESCI staff members from those
with whom they have official dealings must be governed by the highest standards. For the
purposes of these provisions, the term “gift” includes any benefit, which is given to a
GESCI staff member free of charge or at a favourable rate. The following general
guidelines provide a framework within which decisions in this area can be made. GESCI
staff members must abide by these guidelines.  Subject to any rules which the CEO may determine, a member of staff may accept and retain
gifts of modest value (e.g. diaries, pens, etc.). Any gifts of more significant value should be
refused or, if such refusal would cause offence, should be handed over by the GESCI staff
member concerned to the Manager Finance and Administration.
