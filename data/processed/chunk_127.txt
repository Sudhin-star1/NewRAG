8 SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE AT WORK
As a Nairobi-headquartered organization, GESCI follows the guidelines of and complies
with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of Kenya (2007) (the OSHA). The Safety
Statement and Risk Assessment below apply to all GESCI staff regardless of location,
including:
• Staff based at GESCI offices in Nairobi
• Staff working at Ministry or client offices
• Staff working from home
• Travelling on company business. Many of the issues in the Safety Statement below are generic and apply to all types of offices. GESCI will, subject to the relevant law, undertake Risk Assessment audits periodically to
identify issues relating specifically to GESCI and these issues are also included in the Safety
Statement. If there are any safety, health and welfare at work issues that Staff feel are not addressed in
this document, they should be brought to the attention of management.
