should report the situation immediately to one of the following members of
management: Executive Director, Chair, Vice Chair, or Treasurer of the Board
of Directors. If an employee makes a report to one of these persons and the
employee does not receive a satisfactory response, the employee shall report the
situation to one of the other designated persons to receive complaints. The organization will investigate all such reports as confidentially as possible. Adverse action will not be taken against an employee because he or she, in good
faith, reports or participates in the investigation of a violation of this policy. Violations of this policy are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including discharge. 3
