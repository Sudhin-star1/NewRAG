law-enforcement standpoint and how to act in the greyareas of values-based ethics that aren’t always

As a matter of fundamental principle, the Foundationrequires the highest ethical standards because publictrust in
our performance is the bedrock of our legitimacy.Donors, volunteers and grant recipients trust theFoundation to
carry out its mission, to be good stewards of endowmentfunds, and to uphold rigorous standards of conduct. The Foundation must earn this trust every day. Itis therefore essential the people involved with theFoundation,
board members, employees and volunteers demonstratetheir ongoing commitment to the core values of integrity,
honesty, impartiality, openness, respect, and responsibility. Simple adherence to the law is not enough. The Foundationwill often need to go beyond legal requirements and
make sure that its actions are transparent, open andresponsive to public concerns.
