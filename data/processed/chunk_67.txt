The salary that is paid will be the lowest point of the scale
for the higher grade assumed unless this would mean no increase in salary, in which case
the employee will be paid one increment (on the higher scale) above his/her normal salary. Because this payment is paid on a temporary basis it is not pensionable and does not accrue
any other benefits. The Temporary Responsibility Allowance (TRA) is normally awarded for short periods
only, (e.g. to cover a vacancy temporarily), not more than 6 months. However, in some
instances (e.g. to cover a long-term sickness absence or maternity leave or to allow a
department to defer a permanent reorganization or restructuring to a more opportune time)
it may be necessary for the temporary appointment to continue beyond the short term. In
all cases if the temporary appointment includes the incremental date for the postholderâ€™s
substantive post the employee will automatically receive the usual incremental rise in
his/her salary whilst on the higher grade.
