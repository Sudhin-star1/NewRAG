original itemized tax invoice/receipts
showing room charge per night and any tax thereon/ an original, detailed statement from
the hotel showing payment in full is required. A credit/debit card receipt, bank statement or
credit card statement, is not detailed and therefore does not meet this requirement. If
accommodation is not available within the maximum provided for in the per diem rate, a
special approval must be obtained in advance for the higher costs. Any difference between
actual accommodation costs incurred and the maximum provided for in the per diem rate
must be returned to the Finance and Administration Manager within 10 days of end of travel. Meals
The portion of the per diem for meals as calculated from the prevailing per diem rate
requires no proof of expenditure or return to GESCI except for tax purposes. Taxes on per diem
Tax rules differ from country to country and in some countries (such as Kenya) the per
diem or part of the per diem may is taxable.
