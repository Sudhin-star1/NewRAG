Some key issues relating to safety,
health and welfare while travelling are outlined below. If staff members have any particular
issues or concerns, they should bring them to the attention of management. 8.7.1 Travel advice for overseas travel
Several governments often issue travel advisories to their nationals. Staff members are
encouraged to regularly check their government’s travel advisories or the government of
Kenya’s travel advisories on the relevant website. In all cases where travel to a particular
country or region is not recommended, written approval for the trip must be obtained from
both the CEO and the member of staff travelling. The approval should consider the
government’s advice and explain how the traveller’s previous experience or better quality
information (e.g. from consular officials, local government officials, the UN, Non-
Governmental Organizations or other reliable local contacts) justifies disregarding that
advice. 8.7.2 Health while travelling
Staff members travelling on GESCI business should always take advice beforehand on
the potential health risk associated with the trip.
