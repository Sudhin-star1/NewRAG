No matter how robust the recruitment process, it isall too easy to employ someone who
underperforms or simply doesn’t fit the organization.Having a probationary period gives you the
opportunity to assess suitability for a role. Youcould find, a few weeks or months into the relationship,
that the employee isn’t able to deliver the performanceor doesn’t have the skills promised at interview,
has poor attendance or timekeeping or just doesn’tfit in terms of company culture or personality. Having a probationary period is also a risk mitigant.The policy and procedure below is one example of
a program. Amend to fit your Foundations’s practices. Policy and Procedure Statement
