3.3.4 Reference Check
The top applicants to a vacancy must have their references verified by email before
appointment. The recruiting Manager or senior management will conduct the reference
check. Internal candidates will not require reference checks. A reference check may include previous employment verification, conduct and
performance at previous employments, reviewing samples of previous work e.g. publications, verification of academic credentials or any other information pertinent to the
vacancy as well as a criminal records check. Candidates found to have a criminal record or candidates that provide pertinent information
during recruitment which is found to be false after a reference check shall be automatically
disqualified from appointment. 3.3.5 Medical Examination
Before an offer of employment is made, prospective staff members will be required to
undergo a medical test to confirm fitness for the job. An offer of an employment contract
will only be made after a satisfactory medical report from a recognized medical practitioner
which confirms the fitness of the selected candidate to work in a full-time capacity in
line with GESCIâ€™s job requirements.
