3.6 Probation
A formal probationary evaluation shall be conducted by the staff Member’s Manager
together with a senior management representative. 3.6.1 Length of Probation
The probationary period will be six months for all staff contract exceeding 12 months. The
probation period may, with the agreement of the staff member, be extended for a further
period (to a maximum of six months) by the staff member's Manager in consultation
with a senior management. Extension may be necessitated if a staff member’s performance
is below a set standard or for disciplinary reasons. In this instance, the staff member is
usually given a period of time to either improve their performance or modify their behavior
before more severe measures are used in line with the Disciplinary and Termination policies
in this Manual.
