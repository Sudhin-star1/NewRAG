The pension
allowance is paid monthly in arrears through the payroll system together with the staff
member’s basic monthly salary provided that staff member will provide proof of contribution to
a registered pension scheme or SACCO. In the event that GESCI establishes a Pension Scheme, staff members will be eligible to
join, and during the term of a staff member’s employment remain a member of such Pension
Scheme, subject to meeting any prequalification condition of the scheme. Further details
of the Pension Scheme will be set out in this Manual from time to time. GESCI will make
a monthly employer’s contribution to the Pension Scheme equivalent to such percentage of
the staff member’s basic salary as may from time to time be decided by GESCI and subject
to prevailing laws in relation to pension. Staff Welfare Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO)
