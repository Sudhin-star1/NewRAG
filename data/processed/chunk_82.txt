5. ATTENDANCE AND LEAVE
GESCI is a small organization whose work is predominantly advisory and knowledge-based
to meet its development objectives. Staff members of GESCI are expected to work together
in project teams, devising innovative solutions and approaches to GESCI’s partners’ needs
and subject to tight deadlines imposed by GESCI’s partners. The nature of this work calls
for close team-work and collaboration, regular “knowledge consultation” or brainstorming,
total trust in other team members and individual integrity and accountability. Team-
cohesion in a situation where staff members come from diverse backgrounds and countries
is paramount. The cyclic nature of the funding also calls for efficiency, effectiveness and
proven impact of GESCI’s work. 5.1 Hours of Work

pm Monday to Friday, with one hour for lunch. GESCI reserves the right to alter these
working hours from time to time. The official working hours for all GESCI staff is 40 hours
