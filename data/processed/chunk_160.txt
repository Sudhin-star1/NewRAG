of the Board shall be final. The Board shall from time to time specify the procedures
governing the right of the CEO to appeal a Board disciplinary decision where the CEO
is the aggrieved party. 9.3.2 The Informal Discussion- pre-disciplinary
This is a chat by the immediate or line Manager with a staff member, which gives the staff
member a chance to state his/her case and enable the Manager to do something to try to
resolve the problem. This will be regarded as a stage where rather than disciplining a staff
member; a directive or advice will be necessary. This may involve problems related to
performance, poor time keeping, grooming, etc. The discussion is not recorded, as this is an
opportunity for staff to reassess and strategize to improve. For the specific case of a staff member's standard of work or behaviour falling below an
acceptable level, the immediate Manager will informally make them aware that this is
unacceptable and point out how it must be improved.
