The best way to ensure the right staff come together is to track individual
strength and weaknesses. Consistent performance appraisals make that information easily
accessible when it is time to hand out new assignments. 3. Identifying promotion candidates
Hiring from within GESCI will keep organizational memory strong, allowing for continuity
of management styles. With performance appraisals, hiring managers will look back over
the applicantâ€™s entire work history to establish if an internal candidate is best suited for a
promotion. 4. Offer feedback
Constructive criticism provides employees with the necessary information to improve their
on-the-job performance. Staff will be informed about performance expectations and
therefore they will be better placed to meet the challenges of excellence. Managers will give
staff feedback about their performance on a regular basis thus opening up lines of
communication, enabling a good working relationship and encouraging a spirit of
collaboration. Both the manager and the staff will work together to tackle the roadblocks to
success. 5. Introducing training programs
Performance reviews offer an excellent time to discuss additional training and continuing
education requirements.
