Failure to observe GESCI IT policies and procedures could result in breach of
confidentiality, thus posing a risk to our business activities and exposing the firm to risk
of legal action. Care should be taken to ensure that information held on GESCI IT system
is not lost, disclosed, modified without authorization or accessed by third parties. Sensitive data should be stored securely or destroyed after use to prevent recovery by
unauthorized persons. 11.2.1 Protecting IT equipment from damage and theft
It is important that staff exercise due care to ensure that GESCI’s IT equipment is looked
after and is protected from physical damage or theft. Laptops and similar portable
computer equipment have been issued to certain members of staff. These assets remain
the property of GESCI, while the staff member has full responsibility for their security. The staff member generally has liability in the event of loss or damage, subject to any
successful claim from GESCI’s insurers. Laptops should always be placed in a secure location overnight or when left for a long
period of time.
