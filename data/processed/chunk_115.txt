7 PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
DEVELOPMENT
GESCI recognizes that itâ€™s most important asset is its staff members who are expected
to exhibit the highest standards of competence, efficiency and integrity in the discharge of
their functions. Their performance will be appraised periodically to ensure that the required
standards of performance are met by well-motivated staff members. GESCI will employ
performance appraisal system where every employee is constructively and fairly assessed,
and training and development needs identified and supported. The purpose of performance
(which includes professional and work-place behavior) appraisal is for:
1. Establishing performance guidelines
The best way to consistently track exceptional performance is through an appraisal process
that will be done regularly, one-on-one, and also through discussions on how the staff is
expected to execute his job responsibilities that will be assessed at the end of the year. 2. Track strengths and weaknesses
We acknowledge that no one person determines an organizations success. Different staff
bring different experience and strengths to the table, allowing projects to succeed with
minimal delays.
