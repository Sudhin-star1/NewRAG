additional increments above the lowest point of the higher scale If it is agreed that the
circumstances are exceptional the maximum salary to be paid will be the fourth point of the
scale for the higher grade. In cases where an employee does not carry out the full duties and responsibilities of the
higher grade, an award of an ad hoc TRA payment may be made to the employee concerned. The amount of such an ad hoc payment will be related to the extent to which the duties and
responsibilities have been undertaken and the length of time (including the initial four
weeks) for which they have been required to be undertaken. In exceptional cases where an employee assumes the responsibilities of another post of the
same or lower grade, whilst maintaining his/her own duties, an award of an ad hoc TRA
payment of 1 or 2 increments within that grade.
