If a staff member hears the alarm the staff member should:
 Switch off any equipment under the staff member’s control and leave the building
by the nearest fire exit.  Not stop to collect personal belongings.  Once outside, not enter the building until the staff members are told it is safe to do
so. Management will on occasion perform fire drills to ensure that procedures are known and
followed in the event of a real fire. 8.4.3 Staff Security
Each office should have restricted access to prevent unauthorised persons from entering the
office. This restricted access should not impede staff in the event of a fire. 8.4.4 First Aid
Each office should have free access to a first aid box. First aid boxes should be checked on
a regular basis and shortages replaced. Staff members have an obligation to ensure that first
aid boxes, like any safety equipment, are not tampered with.
