Staff members should direct all correspondences that are business related to the GESCI
office address and not to their personal addresses. GESCI letterheads are to be used only
for official communication. Stationary on which GESCI name or logo appears must not be
used for personal purposes
b) Press Queries and media
All media queries received at GESCI must be referred to the Communications Manager
who shall consult with the CEO. Staff members may not engage in discussions or
correspondence with a media representative without the prior approval of the CEO. Media queries received by staff members during the course of domestic or foreign
engagements should be handled as carefully as circumstances permit. Wherever
possible, staff membersâ€™ responses should be consistent with stated GESCI
policy and/or commitments, and staff members must avoid offering opinions that do not
reflect these. It is important that staff members avoid offering personal opinions as these
may be misconstrued as official GESCI policy. Under no circumstances may staff
members make statements that be construed as representing offers of commitment on behalf
of GESCI.
