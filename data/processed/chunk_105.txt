Once the booking has been made and confirmed by Finance and Administration, changes
and cancellations must also be approved. Only changes due to legitimate business reasons
will be considered. It is the responsibility of the traveler to ensure that they have all the correct documentation
prior to travel, including valid passport, tickets, visas, accommodation booking references
etc. 6.2.3 Per Diem System
GESCI per diem rates are made up of a portion for accommodation and a portion for meals. The portions are usually expressed as a percentage of the per diem rate and the percentage
allocated to accommodation and meals varies from city to city. The Finance and Administration team use the flight itinerary or e-ticket to calculate the
actual total per diem to be advanced. The per diem is based on the departure time from
the staff memberâ€™s home airport and the arrival time back. Where travel does not require a
flight, the Finance and Administration need some other evidence of the trip.
