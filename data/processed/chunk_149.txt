8.7.3 Personal safety and security
Staff members should take all necessary measures to ensure their personal safety and
security while travelling. All incidents must be reported to GESCI. It is the responsibility of both the staff member and their Manager to ensure that staff
members remain in contact and contactable while travelling, in so far as that is practicable
8.7.4 Travel Insurance
Staff members who travel on GESCI business are covered by GESCI’s travel insurance
policy, a copy of which will be provided to all staff by the HR Manager. Note that

insurance policy. Staff members may contact the HR Manager or the Finance and Administration Manager
for any questions related to GESCI’s travel insurance policy. 8.7.5 Contingency planning
For travel to particular countries, management and staff may need to consider
contingency plans to deal with emergencies (e.g. the visit may need to be postponed or
curtailed if civil or political unrest develops, or seems likely to develop).
