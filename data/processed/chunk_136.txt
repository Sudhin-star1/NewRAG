Risk Assessment / Hazard Analysis
A hazard is anything at work that might cause harm, e.g. electricity, hot surfaces, lifting
heavy loads, slippery floors, and poorly lit stairways etc. Staff must be aware of the potential
hazards and risks involved and report specific hazards to management. A Risk Assessment will be carried out once a year by management in conjunction with a
safety and health advisor. The results will be incorporated in this Safety Statement and
communicated to all staff as well as the relevant statutory authorities required to be notified
under the OSHA. Consultation:
GESCI is committed to consulting with its staff members regarding safety, health and
welfare at work. Staff will be involved in the identification of hazards and trained in dealing
with the hazards identified. This Safety Statement will be included in induction training
and staff will be advised on how to deal with any problems that arise. 8.2 Reporting of Accidents:
Staff are required to report all accidents and near misses, whether resulting in injury or not,
to their Manager and/or the CEO.
