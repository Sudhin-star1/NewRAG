modest payment or benefit in kind if the task, while work related, is not an integral part of
his or her official duties and is carried on outside of normal working hours.  The question of whether or not a task is an integral part of a GESCI staff member’s official
duties may normally be determined by reference to the relevant work programmes. In case
of doubt the GESCI staff member should request his or her Manager or in the case of a
Manager, to the CEO to determine if the task is an integral part of official duties.  Subject to any rules which the CEO may determine, in cases where no payment or other
compensation arises, a small token gift may be accepted by a GESCI staff member by way
of recognition.  Where a GESCI staff member has any doubts concerning the propriety of accepting any
payment or compensation from bodies outside of GESCI, the matter should be referred to a
Manager for determination in accordance with the guidelines outlined above as soon as
possible.
