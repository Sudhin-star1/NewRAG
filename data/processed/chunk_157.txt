• In compensation for a loss to GESCI, deductions from the staff member’s salary for
a specified period of time. • Dismissal or termination of appointment. Staff who have had formal written warnings are not eligible for salary increases, promotions
or transfers during the warning period. 9.3 Disciplinary Procedures
9.3.1. Principles
a) Investigation
The procedures will allow full investigation of an offence and no action will be taken until
the investigation is completed. In cases of serious offences, the staff members shall be
suspended with full pay until the investigation is completed. Investigations will normally start with an initial or preliminary inquiry to determine if there
is merit in the allegations of misconduct and sufficient evidence to proceed with a full
investigation. b) Notification
Where it is determined that there is a sufficient basis to merit an investigation, the staff
member will be notified in writing of the alleged misconduct at the onset of the
investigation. The notice will include a description of the allegations made against the staff
member, and a summary of the staff member's rights and obligations.
