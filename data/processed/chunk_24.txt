If a GESCI staff member is unhappy with the decision of the Manager, he or she
may appeal the matter to a Senior Manager or to the CEO within 7 days of such decision by
the Manager. Failure to observe these policies on avoidance of conflict of interest will be considered a
disciplinary offence and will be subject to GESCI’s disciplinary procedures as set out in
Section 9 of this Manual. 2.2.3 Sexual Harassment Policy
GESCI strictly prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Examples of sexual
harassment include, but are not limited to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favours and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. No one with a supervisory role at GESCI is at any time to threaten or imply that an
individual’s submission to or rejection of sexual advances will in any way influence any
decision regarding that individual’s employment, performance evaluation, advancement,
compensation, assignments or any other term or condition of employment.
