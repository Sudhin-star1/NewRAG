6 GESCI TRAVEL POLICY
6.1 Statement of Policy
The nature of GESCI’s mission and organization means that its staff members may be
asked to travel in the normal course of operations for meetings, conferences, and for other
business reasons. It is the policy of GESCI to pay for costs incurred by staff members in
the course of business-related travel, provided that the expenses are authorized, incurred
and consistent with GESCI’s mission. 6.2 Finance and administration arrangements
6.2.1 Approval to travel
Before travel is undertaken, it shall be authorized in writing by email. In exceptional cases,
staff members may be authorized to travel on oral orders, but such oral authorization shall
require written confirmation. A staff member shall be responsible for ascertaining that he
or she has the proper authorization before commencing travel. Staff members are expected to plan their travel assignments as far in advance as possible
in order to minimize flight costs. Travel for staff members should be initiated by a project or programme manager within the
objectives of their project or programme.
