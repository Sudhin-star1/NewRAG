4.2.1 Salary policy on appointment and promotion
For each new appointment to a post, the point of entry on the salary scale shall be specified
in the letter of appointment and will normally be on the first (lowest) step of the level of
his or her post unless otherwise decided by the CEO. In exceptional cases, new hires with significant and relevant experience, a track record of
achievement relative to the job specification and academic qualification above and beyond
the minimum requirements, may start at a grade higher than the entry point. In such cases,
each two extra years of relevant experience above the required minimum will count towards
1 step for purposes of determining starting salary. Annual increases based on performance,
if required will follow the steps in each grade. Increase to steps 7,8, 9 and 10 will require
at least 2 years with GESCI for each step.
