Given the nature of GESCIâ€™s work described above, staff will be required, from time to
time to work additional hours and undertake travel outside of normal working hours without
additional remuneration. Flexible working hours can be agreed between staff and line managers taking into account
both individual needs and organizational needs. Such arrangements made within
programme/project teams will need to be cleared by the CEO to ensure they do not
jeopardize group activities or other organizational considerations. Any approved flexible
working hours are not a right for the staff affected and flexibility is needed since
organizational priorities should always take priority when there is conflict in time demands
Attendance and Punctuality
Attendance is a key factor in your job performance. Punctuality and regular attendance is
expected of all employees. Excessive absences (whether excused or unexcused), lateness or
leaving early is unacceptable and will be grounds for discipline up to and including
termination. 5.2 Policy on Annual Leave
5.2.1 Annual leave entitlement
Annual leave entitlement for each staff member is set out in their contract of employment.
