Loss of entitlement to return travel expenses
a) A staff member holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment who resigns before
completing two year of service or within one year following the date of his or her
return from travel on home leave or family visit, shall not be entitled to payment of
return travel expenses for himself unless the CEO determines that there are
compelling reasons for authorizing such payment. b) A staff member holding a temporary appointment who resigns before completing
the full term of his or her appointment shall not be entitled to payment of return
travel expenses for himself or herself. c) Entitlement to return travel expenses shall cease if travel has not commenced within
two years of the date of separation. However, where both spouses are staff members
and the spouse who separates first is entitled to return travel expenses, his or her
entitlement shall not cease until two years after the date of separation of the other
