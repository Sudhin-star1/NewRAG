Sick Days
Please notify the team if you are sick and need to take the day off. Even if you
are feeling well enough to work, please work from home until you are completely
recovered, to avoid spreading illness through our small office. How We Work
Email Accounts, Document Sharing & Password Sharing
We will set you up with an organizational Google Suite account. This will
provide you access to all the basic necessities like email, calendar, and shared
storage. Please use your organizational email address for all work-related correspondence,
scheduling, etc. Personal accounts should not be used for work-related activities. You will be granted access to our shared password manager. All passwords that
need to be shared with the organization must be shared using this manager;
passwords should not be shared via email or other insecure methods. Calendars

meetings, vacation time, appointments, and anything else that your teammates
might need to schedule around. Feel free to schedule meetings with other
coworkers on the Google calendar.
