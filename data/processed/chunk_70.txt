In considering such cases GESCI will take
into account the extent to which the duties and responsibilities of the other post have been
undertaken (as in 4 above) having regard to the University’s obligation of care to staff. Payment Calculations
(a) Payment will be based on the difference between the substantive grade, the grade of
the duties being undertaken and the percentage of time spent on the new duties. The line
Manager should make an assessment against the job description to determine the percentage
of the role being undertaken. (b) The payment will be made on a fixed monthly value for the duration of the period for
the additional responsibility allowance. 4.4 Benefits
4.4.1Pension Contribution Allowance
At the moment, GESCI does not run a Pension Scheme. In lieu of the Pension
Scheme, GESCI provides a pension contribution allowance equal to 10% of the staff
member’s basic salary once the probation period is successfully completed.
