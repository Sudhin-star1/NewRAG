5.2.8 Leaving the organization
Upon termination of employment (for whatever reason):
• The Staff member may be required to take any approved outstanding annual leave during
the period of notice. • Where payment in lieu of notice is approved and given, GESCI shall pay any outstanding
accrued but unused leave entitlement. Accrued Annual leave shall not be automatically used to serve for notice period in the event
of termination/resignation of employment. Work priorities permitting, GESCI will do its best
to make time for leave during the notice.
