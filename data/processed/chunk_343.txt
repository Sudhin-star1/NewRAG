Regular Meetings
All meetings must be held in a manner that allows for full participation of all
employees, regardless of such individual variables such as geographic location. Daily Standup(s)
To better coordinate organizational or product development efforts, one or more
daily standups may be scheduled, each lasting no longer than 15 minutes. The purpose of the daily standup is to provide a short summary of what you
focused on the previous day, what you are planning on focusing on today, and,
critically, identification of any obstacles or blockers that may prevent you from
completing a task. 9
