from time to time. Currently, Company Holidays are as follows:

December 24th to January 1st), GESCI offices will be opened on the first working day following
the new year in January
• Easter: 1 working day at the Easter weekend, being the Thursday before Easter. Including
public holidays, this means that the GESCI offices are closed from Thursday to Monday

these holidays to accommodate the requirements of that religion. 5.2.3 Public holidays
