to advance personal interests or to obtain favors or benefits for themselves,
members of their families or any other individuals, corporations, or business

conflict of interest could be created. Should you encounter a situation that suggests a conflict of interest, please refer

the Board of Directors as to whether a conflict exists, and if it exists, whether it
is an allowable conflict.
