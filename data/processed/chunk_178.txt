allegations. The information provided must present sufficient detail or supporting
evidence which amounts to a prima-fascia case for an initial investigation so that the matter
can be pursued responsibly. Otherwise, the matter usually cannot be pursued further. Even where anonymous allegations are sufficiently detailed or supported to permit a
responsible investigation to be conducted, no final finding of misconduct will be made
based solely on the anonymous allegations without independent corroboration. All
anonymous allegations, should they remain anonymous, will always be treated with caution
by GESCI.
