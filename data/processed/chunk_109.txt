Tax on per diem does not apply for expatriates
working for GESCI as long as they enjoy the tax exemption status in Kenya. All staff
members are responsible for ensuring that they are tax compliant in their own country of
residence. Staff members resident in countries where a portion of the per diem is taxable
are advised to keep receipts for their own tax compliance purposes. 6.2.4 Other expenses
Staff members are allowed to claim all other approved travel and business-related expenses
through their expense claim or travel cost statement. This includes visas, taxi fares, and
specific business-related medical expenses. All expense claims must be supported by
original itemized receipts.
