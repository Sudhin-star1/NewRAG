Manual Handling:
Manual Handling is defined as the “transporting of a load by one or more staff members
and includes lifting, putting down, pushing, carrying or moving a load, which by reason
of its characteristics or of unfavourable ergonomic conditions involves risks, particularly
of back injury to staff members”. This is an important issue because it is a major cause of accidents in the workplace. It is
GESCI’s policy to minimise the need for manual handling of loads and so therefore should
be avoided as far as is reasonably practicable. Staff members must check the weight of the load before attempting to lift it and if the load
is too heavy get help. When lifting, follow the following basic principles:
• Relax the knees. Lowering movements should start at the knees not the head. • Get close to the object to be lifted. Get a good balance by keeping the feet apart. One foot will automatically be ahead of the other. • When in position, bend the knees and lift with the strong muscles in the legs.
