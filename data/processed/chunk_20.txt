 No objection would normally be made to the acceptance of what is regarded as routine
hospitality, for example, a business lunch. What may be regarded as “routine” for this
purpose will depend on a number of factors such as the value of the hospitality offered, the
frequency of offers, whether there is an element of reciprocity and the general circumstances
in which it is offered (for example, whether it is offered by a company to all its customers
or is directed at specific or potential customers). Certain types of hospitality (for example
involving travelling abroad or holiday weekends) should not be regarded as routine and
should always be referred to the CEO for direction.  GESCI staff members should not accept offers of hospitality which go beyond the routine
practices referred to above, except where acceptance of such an offer can be clearly shown
to be in the interest of GESCI and has been approved by his or her Manager.
