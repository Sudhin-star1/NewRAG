with under the Companyâ€™s disciplinary procedure. Visitors, contractors and temporary
members of staff are expected to abide by the terms of this policy. Advice and Guidelines for VDU users
As part of their duties some staff members spend long periods of time using visual display
screens. Any necessary adjustments will be made to avoid RSI, eyestrain and other ailments
associated with work on screens, which must be adjustable for height, tilt and brightness. No staff member will be asked or expected to work any computer which is not in proper
working condition, or does not meet the highest specifications. Staff members working continuously on-screen should alternate tasks so that at least 10
minutes during each 60 minutes of work is spent doing off-screen type of work. This work
is to be undertaken away from the screen, but does not constitute a break.
