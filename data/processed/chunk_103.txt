Individual travel proposals are formulated in
conjunction with project/ programme managers and costed travel proposals are submitted
to the senior manager and/or the CEO for approval. In the preparation of costed travel
proposals, project or programme managers should consult the Finance and Administration
team for cost estimates. Costed proposals should reach the senior manager and/or the CEO
not less than a month prior to the proposed travel. The costed travel proposal should include:
a) The name of the person(s) travelling
b) Itinerary with times and dates of departure and return
c) Expected cost of flight, per diem allowance and other costs
d) Programme to which the travel assignment relates (and where it is budgeted)
e) Specific activity or task in the Programmeâ€™s Work Plan to which the travel contributes
f) Reason for travel
If the proposed travel dates / location / purpose / expected costs change then the travel
proposal must be updated and major changes approved again. The final costed travel
proposal should match the final itinerary as much as possible.
