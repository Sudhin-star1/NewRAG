When these conditions are not met, the absence shall be treated as unauthorized
absence. Obligations of staff members
a) Staff members shall inform their immediate Manager as soon as possible of absences
due to illness or injury. This usually means within 2 hours after the normal starting
time by telephone or other message. The immediate Manager should promptly notify
the CEO and the HR manager of the staff member’s absence due to illness or injury. b) Staff members shall promptly submit any medical certificate or medical report required
under conditions to be specified by the CEO. c) A staff member may be required to submit a medical report as to his or her condition or to
undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner designated by GESCI. When, in
the opinion of the designated medical practitioner, a medical condition impairs a staff
member’s ability to perform his or her functions, the staff member may be directed not to
attend the office and requested to seek treatment from a duly qualified medical practitioner.
