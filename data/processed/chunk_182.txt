Where positions are reduced in number resulting in
redundancies, the selection of staff members whose employment is redundant will be
made on the basis of managerial judgment about the skills needed by GESCI to carry
out its work effectively, taking into account the following factors:
• Whether the abilities and experience of staff members can be used elsewhere in
GESCI; and
• The existence of volunteers for termination who are willing to accept severance
payments as set out further below. • The performance (including professional and work-place behavior) of staff
members;
• The seniority in time, skill, ability and reliability of each staff member affected by
the redundancy;
Notice of termination for redundancy
A staff member whose employment has been declared redundant will receive one
month’s written notice giving reasons for the redundancy. In lieu of notice, GESCI may provide a payment equal to one month salary to the staff
member. Such payments in lieu will not be considered part of severance pay.
