Political activities: Whilst GESCI staffs are free to hold their own political views; these
views should not interfere with the business of GESCI. A staff member of GESCI may
not participate in political or other activities outside GESCI in any way which is detrimental
to the proper performance of her/his duties. No staff member may use GESCI to promote
her/his own personal political interests. All staff members of GESCI should note that
GESCI is non-political and non-partisan. vii. Unprofessional conduct: that would bring the staff member’s professional ethics, image or
integrity or GESCI’s reputation into question. 2.2.2 Avoidance of Conflict of Interest Policy
In view of the nature of GESCI’s activities and the possible risk to GESCI’s reputation, it
is GESCI’s policy that staff members do not accept gifts, benefits or favours (including non-
work related hospitality) connected with their employment from any external party,
including partners and/or clients as these may be interpreted as affecting their impartiality
in dealing with such other party including partners and/or clients.
