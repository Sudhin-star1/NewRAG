11.2.7Electronic Mail (e-mail)
All emails systems and communications made on the system remains the sole property
of GESCI and consequently should generally only be used for business related purposes. GESCI reserves the right to inspect the system at any time. Staff members must ensure that they regularly delete mail that is not required from
the system. Staff members’ network behaviour should reflect the standard professional
conduct. GESCI’s electronic system should never be used to propagate, politicise,
disseminate or participate in the propagation of any form of electronic chain letter,
or any unlawful, harassing, threatening, obscene or sexually explicit message to anyone
within GESCI or elsewhere. Staff members should also be wary about who is addressed in e-mails and should consider
the appropriate audience before messages are sent out to “everyone in GESCI” or to
external parties. 11.2.8Use of Internet
When using the Internet, every staff member should always remember that Internet use
leaves electronic tracks, which identify GESCI.
