c) Right to Defence
To ensure fairness the staff member concerned will have an opportunity to state his or
her case and to be represented by a colleague if so desired. Depending on the level of the
staff member being investigated, the CEO or the Board will constitute a Disciplinary
Committee. If any witnesses are called to give evidence before the Disciplinary Committee the staff
member shall be entitled to be present to cross-examine such witnesses. The staff member
may call witnesses in her/his defence. No documentary evidence shall be used against the
staff member unless she/he has previously been provided with a copy thereof or unless
she/he has been given access thereto. d) Rights of Appeal
A staff member has a right of appeal at any stage against any disciplinary action that may
be taken. A staff member who wishes to appeal against an administrative decision shall
address her/his petition to the CEO within 7 days of receiving notification of the decision.
