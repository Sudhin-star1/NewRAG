7.2 Managing unsatisfactory performance
If a Manager determines that a staff member's performance (which includes professional and
work-place behaviour) is not satisfactory, the immediate Manager in conjunction with the
line Manager will discuss, share and document opportunities to improve performance deemed
unsatisfactory with the staff member in writing:
The aspects of performance that are not satisfactory,
 Guidance on what improvement is expected and by when, and
 The possible consequences of failure to improve. The immediate manager in conjunction with the line manager may request that the CEO:
a) Request a health assessment from a duly registered medical practitioner if performance problems
are believed to be health-related. b) Consider reassigning the staff member to another position or assignment to a lower level position
provided that the staff member has been given a reasonable opportunity to improve their
performance. In the case of failure to achieve or sustain satisfactory performance following a documented
opportunity to improve, a Manager may recommend, with the concurrence of the CEO and the
senior management termination for unsatisfactory performance as detailed under the section
on Separation from Service.
