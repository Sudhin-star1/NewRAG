Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under their employment
contract; with GESCI’s constitution, the contents of this HR Manual or other relevant
administrative issuances or to observe the standards of conduct expected of a staff member
of an international organization may be perceived as misconduct and may lead to the
institution of a disciplinary process and the subsequent imposition of disciplinary measures
for misconduct. All GESCI staff members are subject to disciplinary action as and when their performance,
behavior or conduct warrants it. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, disciplinary
action will range from verbal reprimand to summary dismissal. 9.1 Staff member Grievance Procedure
The purpose of the staff member grievance procedure is to ensure that any staff member
who feels he/she has not received fair and equitable treatment may, without fear of reprisal,
bring his/her complaint to the attention of the staff member’s immediate Manager or a
Senior Manager or CEO for appropriate consideration and resolution. Complaints of alleged violations of established policies and practices should be addressed
through the grievance procedure.
