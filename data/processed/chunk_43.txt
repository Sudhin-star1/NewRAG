3.2 Classification of posts and staff
The CEO and Board may periodically revise the classification system under use. In general,
the posts and staff are classified as follows:
a) International Professional category: international posts are subject to international
recruitment and where global mobility and international experience are essential. International posts are only available to professional staff such as Managers (process,
project and senior Managers), specialists and experts, project officers and other
related posts. These posts usually require an advanced university degree and some
minimum work experience. b) National (local) Professional category: These posts are subject to local recruitment
where global mobility and international experiences are not essential or where specific
local experience is required.
