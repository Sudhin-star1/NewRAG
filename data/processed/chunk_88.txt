restriction on the number of days that may be taken at once by the staff member. Where
the annual leave entitlement is divided into different parts to be taken at different intervals
(e.g. due to work pressures or on request from GESCI), the staff member shall be required
to consent to this division in writing. In addition, unless GESCI and the staff member
otherwise agree and on condition that the length of service of the staff member during any
leave earning period entitles them to such period, one of the parts agreed upon shall be at
least 14 uninterrupted working days. Final approval for leave must be sought from and provided by the CEO. 5.2.5 Records
Annual leave entitlements and time taken form part of the staff member’s HR records. The HR Manager maintains an annual leave record for each staff member and this is the
official record of the staff member’s leave.
