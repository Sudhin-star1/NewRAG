8.6 Working from Home
If a staff member works from home whether at the request of GESCI or of the staff member
with GESCI’s consent then their home is regarded as a location of work which comes within
the scope of the OSHA. So the policies and requirements set out in this document apply to
home-workers just as they do to office-based staff. Staff should be aware that under the OSHA, duly authorized occupational safety and health
officers are entitled to visit any location of work, including the home-based office. To
meet its legal requirements, GESCI reserves the right to inspect any home-working
environment and, if any health and safety issues arise, these must be resolved to GESCI’s
satisfaction in order for the home-working arrangement to continue. 8.7 Travelling on GESCI business
Given the nature of GESCI’s business, global travel is a regular activity for many
GESCI staff. GESCI regards the health, safety and security of its staff as paramount – particularly when
travelling or working away from GESCI offices.
