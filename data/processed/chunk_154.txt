Manager, if the complaint involves the staff member’s Manager, or if the staff member does
not feel comfortable or does not wish to discuss the matter with his/her Manager, the staff
member should bring the issue to the attention of the HR Manager in writing and within 30
days after the Manager’s decision, or 30 days lapsing without resolution or satisfactory
resolution of the issue or within 30 days of the issue occurring where the issue involves the
Manager or the staff member does not feel comfortable discussing the issue with
