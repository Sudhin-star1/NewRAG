public holidays or weekends, a line manager can recommend an appropriate
acknowledgement of this additional work through time off for that staff member. Such
provision should be taken at periods convenient to both staff and the organization and will
need to be approved by the CEO. Recall from Leave
GESCI may recall a staff member from leave or cancel authorization to proceed on annual
leave due to an emergency situation. In such events, whatever annual leave days remain due
to the staff member should be taken as early as possible within the same year or may be
carried forward into the next year subject to the policy on accumulation on leave above. 5.2.2 Company holidays
In addition to annual leave, GESCI grants Company Holidays. Company Holidays are days
when the GESCI offices are closed. Company Holidays apply to all staff, whether office-
based or not. However, the leave can only be taken at this time. It cannot be carried forward
and cannot be added to the annual leave entitlement.
