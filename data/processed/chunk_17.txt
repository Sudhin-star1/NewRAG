 A gift, other than a gift of modest value, given to a GESCI staff member by virtue of his or
her official relationship with the provider of the benefit must be regarded as property of
GESCI. However, benefits under frequent flier schemes may be retained by individual
GESCI staff members in recognition of the fact that official travel is disruptive to personal
and family life.  Particular care should be taken in relation to gifts from a provider of the benefit who stands
to derive a personal or commercial benefit from their relationship with GESCI.  Cash, gift cheques or any vouchers that may be exchanged for cash may not be accepted
regardless of the amount.  GESCI staff members may not solicit gifts, directly or indirectly.  GESCI staff members may not approach any business with which they have contact through
their official duties seeking sponsorship or support for any club, charitable organization,
association, trade union or other organization. The CEO can apply discretion in the
application of this rule to instances of very small patronage.
