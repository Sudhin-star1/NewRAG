9.3.6 Summary or Instant Dismissal
Should a staff member of GESCI be guilty of a very serious offence such as a criminal
offence, embezzlement or misappropriation of GESCI’s funds or any other grounds for
summary dismissal under the relevant Kenyan labour law, she/he will be liable to “instant”
or summary dismissal. Disciplinary offences such as those described as gross misconduct
are liable to summary dismissal. The procedure to be followed on a charge of gross
misconduct shall be similar to that described above in sub-section 9.2.4 save that the staff
member will (if the decision is so taken) be summarily dismissed instead of receiving a final
written warning.
