8.4.2 Fire Procedures
Each office should have a fire alarm, readily accessible fire extinguishers, a documented
fire evacuation procedure and safe exit. In the event of a fire and providing there is no danger to the persons concerned every effort
should be made to extinguish or contain the fire pending the arrival of the fire brigade. The
magnitude of the outbreak must dictate whether attacking the fire should take priority over
reporting and evacuation. All staff should be familiar with the exit routes and should also
know the location and type of fire extinguishers in the office. If a staff member discovers a fire the staff member should:
 Activate the fire alarm.  Not under any circumstances, expose themselves to danger.  Leave the building by the nearest fire exit and proceed to their designated
assembly point.
