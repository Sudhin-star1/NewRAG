b) Hospitality
Hospitality, as used here, is defined as the entertainment of staff members by clients,
partners or other outside organizations or persons in the course of conducting GESCI
business. It is impossible to lay down definite rules covering the acceptance of hospitality
in all circumstances. It is accepted that GESCI staff members should not be put in a position
where they cannot accept what are regarded as normal courtesies in business relationships. However, in their contacts with outside organizations or persons, every care must be taken
by GESCI staff members to ensure that their acceptance of hospitality does not influence
their official functions. The following general guidelines provide a framework within which decisions in this area can
be made or local rules formulated. GESCI may apply these rules on hospitality or make local
rules derived from them. ï‚· All offers of hospitality from commercial interests which have or might have contractual
relations with GESCI must be reported by the GESCI staff member to the CEO for direction.
